  <h1>CP3402 - Supplementary Assignment</h1>

  <h2>Name: Jeomin Gimmi</h2>

  <h2>Goal/s</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of this project was to develop a fully functional, responsive WordPress website for U3A Townsville using a custom child theme. 
    The website aims to provide information about membership, events, news, and community support while reflecting a clean, modern, and accessible design.
    The deployment was automated via GitHub Actions to a publicly accessible AWS Lightsail instance, with all theme files under version control.
    Success was measured by fully automated deployment, a visible live theme on the server, and functional page navigation.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Links</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://3.107.158.231" target="_blank">Production Site</a></li>
    <li>Local environment: WordPress site containerized using Docker for local development. Theme files were edited using Visual Studio Code, version controlled via GitHub, and deployed to production using GitHub Actions and AWS Lightsail - http://localhost/8080:80</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/users/jeomin12/projects/3" target="_blank">Project management board</a></li>

  </ul>

  <h2>References (sources of copied resources)</h2>
  <p>
    Images used in the design were either sourced AI generated images or directly provided through U3A Townsville internal documents.
    Theme structure was based on the WordPress “twentytwentyfive” parent theme. Deployment steps were implemented based on GitHub Actions documentation and tutorials at GitHub Docs, AI help and Bitnami WordPress + Lightsail configuration guides.

  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <p>
    All development and deployment were done in compliance with the assignment guidelines. No manual plugin or content export/import was used.
    Pages were created on the production server to ensure adherence to deployment-only content rules. GitHub Actions deployment was confirmed functional after debugging multiple path and key errors.
    All core templates, such as about, membership, contact, and support, are visible in the production site once they are created in the WordPress admin and assigned the correct templates.
