    <h2>Our Origins</h2>
    <p>U3A Townsville was founded as part of a global movement to encourage lifelong learning for seniors. Since its early days, it has grown from a handful of volunteers into a thriving community with hundreds of members and dozens of weekly programs.</p>

    <p>Inspired by the international University of the Third Age (U3A) philosophy, we began offering peer-led education in everything from language and philosophy to arts, fitness, and technology.</p>
